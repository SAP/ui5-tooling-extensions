## Requirements

The offered extensions require UI5 CLI Version 3 and above.

## Packages

UI5 CLI Extensions consist of multiple packages managed in a separate folder:

These extensions are developed and maintained by SAP. There are many more UI5 CLI extensions available developed by the open-source community. Check out [Best of UI5](https://bestofui5.org/) to explore the world of custom UI5 CLI middlewares/tasks, UI5 controls and more.
